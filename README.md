# Esteban Chacon Martin — "etherbeing"

I'm a pentester and software developer with several years of experience building automation tools, web services, scraping utilities, network sniffers and packet-crafting tools, and in Linux systems administration. I work across the full stack and enjoy designing reliable, maintainable systems and tooling that make security research, development and operations more productive.

Beyond software engineering, I explore biologically-inspired neural architectures, game development, and general research across computer science and adjacent fields. I also have broad interests in philosophy, human rights, politics, mathematics, and Asian culture (especially Japan).

Selected projects
1. CVE Forge — https://github.com/etherbeing/cveforge  
   An actionable framework for penetration testing. Uses scapy, Beautiful Soup, asyncio, rich, prompt_toolkit, and concurrency primitives to automate discovery and exploit workflows.

2. EGO: Human Like Analysis — https://github.com/etherbeing/ego  
   Biologically-inspired neural architecture (work in progress — not released yet; ETA ~2–3 years). Developed primarily in Rust and cargo with a focus on research-grade performance and explicit control over memory and execution.

3. etherbeing (personal website) — https://github.com/etherbeing/etherbeing.github.io
   This repository powers my GitHub Pages personal site, developed with Astro.

4. automation — https://github.com/etherbeing/automation  
   Django projects and related libraries for automation of common web application tasks.

5. unfold — https://github.com/etherbeing/unfold/  
   Full-stack web application using Rust on the backend (sqlx, Actix Web) and Svelte on the frontend.

6. devops — https://github.com/etherbeing/devops/  
   Dockerfiles and deployment utilities for standard containerized deployments.

7. senjor — https://github.com/etherbeing/senjor/  
   A library intended to generate GraphQL APIs directly from models; development was paused after evaluating existing projects (e.g., Strawberry).

8. recaptchav3 — https://github.com/etherbeing/recaptchav3/  
   Reusable snippet for integrating reCAPTCHA v3 in Django + DRF using standard permissions.

9. demomanager — https://github.com/etherbeing/demomanager/  
   Utilities to load demo data into Django projects using the Faker library.

10. smoothlify — https://github.com/etherbeing/smoothlify/  
    Small library to make async or non-blocking requests to servers easy without manual fetch boilerplate.

11. sly — https://github.com/etherbeing/sly_browser/  
    Early personal programming-language project that explored ideas for web-oriented runtimes and templating.

12. powerhouse — https://github.com/etherbeing/powerhouse  
    A programming language prototype written in Rust, inspired by Python but focused on systems-level tasks such as file access and device interaction.

13. django-translator — https://github.com/etherbeing/django_translator/  
    Django helper library for translating content using the google-translator package.

14. cryptopass — https://github.com/etherbeing/cryptopass/  
    Cryptocurrency tracker written in JavaScript.

15. CryptoTracker — https://github.com/etherbeing/CryptoTracker/  
    Cryptocurrency tracking tools written in Python.

16. TFProtocol Java Client — https://github.com/etherbeing/tfprotocol  
    L4 (IP/TCP and IP/UDP) communication protocol implementation with custom cryptography and performance-oriented features.

How I work
- I prefer pragmatic, well-tested solutions that scale from prototype to production.
- I write tools to automate repetitive tasks and reduce human error in security testing.
- I value readable code, reproducible environments, and small, maintainable abstractions.
